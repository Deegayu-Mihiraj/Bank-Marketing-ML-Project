# Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction

### Description
This project predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using the Bank Marketing dataset. Two machine learning models, Random Forest and Neural Network, were implemented and compared.

### models Used
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Feedforward Neural Network Classifier

### Key Highlights
Data preprocessing and feature engineering were applied for optimal model performance.
Both models were evaluated based on:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
     
### Repository Structure
- `main.py`: Main script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `bank-full.csv`: Input dataset.

### Results
| Model            | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| Random Forest    | 0.90     |
| Neural Network   | 0.88     |

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly Random Forest and Neural Networks, in predicting term deposit subscriptions. While both models performed well, Random Forest achieved slightly higher accuracy, making it a more suitable choice for this task. Future enhancements could involve hyperparameter tuning and incorporating advanced interpretability tools for better insights into model predictions.
